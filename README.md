<b> Visualizing my everyday spending in hopes to see some pattern and hopefully make few improvements. </b>

<p>
  Given the introduction of mobile banking in Bhutan, I find myself constantly using mbob everywhere as more and more shops accept it. This  digital introduction means easy access to your spending history and habits.</p>

  The data for this is limited only to mbob transactions. Eventually, I plan to allow users to enter their data as well.
